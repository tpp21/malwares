# malwares
    re you really interested about viruses and curious how they would react on a PC?      It is stored on github for some reasons (I don't want my site to be marked as a malicious one!)       Disclaimer:      This site doesn't promote any illegal activites. Once the user had downloaded any viruses from Github, it is not our responsibility anymore. So always use it for your own entertainment purposes! Don't use it as a weapon to destory others PCs because viruses are "not a toy to play with unless you knew how to do so! Cause some of them can even cause permenent damage to the PC and cannot be recovered anymore" So please use it for only entertainment purposes only!         ⚠️REMEMBER⚠️ Always use a virtual machine to test viruses and never use a real PC! If You Don't have any virtual machines installed on your system google it and download it!
